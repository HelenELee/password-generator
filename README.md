# Password Generator

## Description
This web page was developed to allow employers to generate a random passwords based on chosen criteria such as password length, uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. The web page has a "Generate Password" button which when clicked triggers a series of questions to gather the password criteria from the user. The password is generated and entered in a text box on the web page. The user can click on the password and it will be copied to the clipboard so it can be pasted elsewhere. There is also a "Clear" button to remove the generated password from the screen.

The password generator is developed using a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Noteworthy features are:
*Event listeners
*General input and number validation from prompt/confirm
*Math.random to get random elements from string
*Copy to clipboard
*Shuffle characters in string
*Use of Object to store password criteria


The main challenges were with creating a simple user interface, ensuring the user experience was intuitive and covered all user needs.
